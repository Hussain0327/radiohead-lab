# 🎧 Radiohead Data Lab

A personal data science project exploring Radiohead’s music through analytics, statistics, and natural language processing.

This repo exists mostly because I like Radiohead — and because music is a great excuse to explore patterns, structure, and emotion using data.

---

## What I’m Exploring

This project treats Radiohead’s discography as a dataset and asks questions like:

- How do themes and sentiment evolve across albums?
- Are there measurable differences between early and later eras?
- Do certain words, topics, or emotions cluster by album?
- Can statistical patterns explain why some songs *feel* different?

This is not a product and not a benchmark. It’s a sandbox for curiosity.

## Planned Analyses

### 🎵 Data Analytics
- Song-level statistics (tempo, duration, structure)
- Album-level comparisons
- Trends over time across the discography

### 📝 NLP on Lyrics
- Tokenization and frequency analysis
- Sentiment and emotion analysis
- Topic modeling across albums
- Keyword and phrase evolution over time

### 📊 Statistical Analysis
- Hypothesis testing between albums or eras
- Distribution comparisons (length, sentiment, vocabulary)
- Correlation between lyrical features and popularity metrics

### 🤖 Optional ML (Exploratory)
- Clustering songs by lyrical or musical features
- Dimensionality reduction for visualization
- Simple classifiers for album or era prediction

## Tools & Stack

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- NLP libraries (spaCy / NLTK / transformers, as needed)
- Jupyter notebooks for exploration

## Why This Project Exists

Most of my other work is production-oriented and serious by design.

This one is deliberately different:
- No pressure to optimize
- No performance benchmarks
- Just structured exploration using data

Sometimes the best way to stay sharp is to analyze something you actually care about.

## Status

Early exploration. Not all analyses are implemented yet.

This repo will grow organically as questions come up.
