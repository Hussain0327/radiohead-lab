The album closer was True Love Waits - but transformed. The lush band arrangement was gone. Just Thom, alone at the piano. Rachel Owen, Thom's partner of 23 years and mother of their children, passed away in December 2016. Twenty-one years of waiting to release a song called 'True Love Waits,' and when they finally did, it was a goodbye.",
